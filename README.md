# Psygraph

Psygraph is a Personal Data Collector (PDC) and activity timer. It includes a stopwatch, timer, counter, and note taker (voice recorder), each of which collects data from the deviceâ€™s sensors (e.g. the device velocity and location (via GPS)). Although the interface is simple (a button or two on each screen), the data is saved for later analysis and display (you can store and view the data on WordPress). It is a scientific instrument that is easy to use.

It makes an excellent general-purpose stopwatch and timer, but you can also categorize the data that you collect, so that time, location, and velocity data is associated with that category (or activity). Psygraph allows quantification and visualization of your behavior (biofeedback) by utilizing data gathered from your mobile device. It provides objective measurements about what you spend your time doing, and where you do it.  Your location can be monitored using either GPS or cell network sources, but keep in mind that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

You can use Psygraph to log your meditation sessions, your race car laps, your psychology experiments, or anything else.
