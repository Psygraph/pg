      <p><strong>Welcome to Psygraph</strong></p>
      
      <p>Psygraph keeps track of your meditation, breathing, and mindfulness through the use of various tools, such as a timer, counter, periodic gong, and note-taker. Each tool records events in response to button presses or device sensor changes, and those events are stored on your phone. You can optionally upload that information to any server with the Psygraph WordPress plugin to further analyze or visualize that event data.</p>

      
      <h3>View Menu</h3>
      <p>Each tool has its own page, which you access by clicking on <i>View</i> menu at the upper-left of the app. Each tool has three tabs: a primary tab (with the name of the tool), a tab for the tool settings, and a tab with information about the tool.</p>
      <p>The <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#menuHelp"><b>Home</b></a> page lets you go online, and displays the status. The other tools are:
        <ul>
          <li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#stopwatch_help"><b>Stopwatch:</b></a> Time your meditations and track your stillness.</li>
          <li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#counter_help"><b>Counter:</b></a> Measure your awareness by counting your breaths.</li>
          <li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#timer_help"><b>Timer:</b></a> Set bells for the end of a meditation, or schedule random alarms with inspiration quotes.</li>
          <li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#note_help"><b>Note:</b></a> Track your thoughts with text and audio notes that automatically create blog posts.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To select and visualize events that you have recorded with those tools, use the <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#list_help"><b>List</b></a>, <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#graph_help"><b>Graph</b></a>, and <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#map_help"><b>Map</b></a> pages.</p>

      
      <h3>Action Menu</h3> 
      <p>The <i>Action</i> menu is accessed by clicking the button at the top-right of the app.  It has the following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>About:</b> Open the About dialog.</li>
        <li><b>Preferences:</b> Open the app <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#preferences_help">Preferences</a> to specify global options.</li>
        <li><b>Categories:</b> Open the <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#categories_help">Categories</a> page to edit the categories.</li>
        <li><b>Login/Logout:</b> Login or logout of the WordPress server.</li>
        <li><b>Help:</b> Open the Help page.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Suggested Workflow</h3> 
      <p>There are a number of tools within Psygraph, and you can use it in different ways.  That said, here is a suggestion for a 30-minute meditation session:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, begin with a good attitude: loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity.  This app can't teach you that, and that's possibly the most important step.  Many people find it beneficial to remember that they are a part of larger whole, not merely a whole composed of smaller parts.</li>
        <li>Sit in your favorite place and start the <strong>stopwatch</strong>, so that you will have a record of the time that you have spent in formal meditation.</li>
        <li>Switch to the breath <strong>counter</strong> and meditate while counting breaths (5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Switch to the <strong>timer</strong> and set it to deliver messages in a loop every 4-8 minutes (20 minutes).</li>
        <li>Switch to the <strong>note</strong> page and record any insights you might have had (5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Close the meditation with a prayer or dedication.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After doing this for some time, you may wish to check your progress, which you can do by looking at the simple chart on the <strong>home</strong> page or by graphing the data.  If you are collecting data for more thorough analysis, you can download that data in CSV format from the server.</p>
      <p>However you end up using the app, may it be of benefit to you and all beings.</p>
