      <strong>Welcome to Psygraph</strong>
      
      <p>Psygraph keeps track of your meditation, breathing, and mindfulness through the use of various tools, such as a timer, counter, periodic gong, and note-taker. Each tool records events in response to button presses or device sensor changes, and those events are stored on your phone. You can optionally upload that information to any server with the Psygraph WordPress plugin to further analyze or visualize that event data.</p>
      
      <p>Each tool has its own page. The main page is the <b>Home</b> page, which displays the device status. The other tools are:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Stopwatch:</b> Time your meditations and track your stillness.</li>
        <li><b>Timer:</b> Set bells for the end of a meditation, or schedule random alarms with inspiration quotes.</li>
        <li><b>Counter:</b> Measure your awareness by counting your breaths.</li>
        <li><b>Note:</b> Track your thoughts with text and audio notes that automatically create blog posts.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>To select and visualize events that you have recorded with those tools, use the <b>Home</b>, <b>List</b>, and<b>Graph</b> pages.</p>
      
      <p>Further help is available for the following topics:</p>

      <strong>Menus</strong>      <p>The menu bar at the top of the app has buttons that let you View a different tool, or perform an Action.  Below that are three tabs for each tool: a main tab, a settings tab, and an info tab.  The Action menu displays the following options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>About:</b> Open the About dialog.</li>
        <li><b>Prefs:</b> Open the app <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#preferencesHelp">Preferences</a> to specify global options.</li>
        <li><b>Login/Logout:</b> Login or logout of the WordPress server.</li>
        <li><b>Help:</b> Open the Help page.</li>
      </ul>

    <div id="categoryHelp">

      <strong>Categories</strong>
      <p>All events (such as stopwatch start/stop times) are assigned to a category.  Four categories are present by default: <em>Uncategorized</em>, <em>Meditate</em>, <em>Exercise</em>, and <em>Think</em>.  The current category can be changed via the tool settings tab.</p>
      <p>New categories can be added in the application Preferences.  Every category has settings that govern its behavior, such as a particular background color, sound, and set of strings that are displayed by the timer alarms.  Those settings are accessed by going to the Category Prefs dialog via the application preferences.  Finally, if you are uploading your data to a WordPress server, that data is tagged with its associated category.</p>
