    <strong>Welcome to Psygraph</strong>

    <p class="help">Psygraph keeps track of your meditation, breathing, and mindfulness through the use of various tools, such as a timer, counter, periodic gong, and note-taker. Each tool records events in response to button presses or device sensor changes, and those events are stored on your phone. You can optionally upload that information to any server with the Psygraph WordPress plugin to further analyze or visualize that event data.</p>

    <p class="help">Each tool has its own page. The main page is the <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#homePage">Home</a> page, which displays the device status. The other tool are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#stopwatchHelp">Stopwatch</a></li>
<li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#timerHelp">Timer</a></li>
<li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#counterHelp">Counter</a></li>
<li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#noteHelp">Note</a></li>
<li><a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#listHelp">List</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you turn on the debugging preference, you can also access <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#graphHelp">Graph</a>, and <a data-ajax="false" class="pageLink" href="#mapHelp">Map</a> (as well as a few other goodies).</p>

    <p class="help">All events (such as stopwatch start and stop times) are assigned to a category. Four categories are present by default (<em>Uncategorized</em>, <em>Meditate</em>, <em>Exercise</em>, and <em>Think</em>), but other categories can be added in the application Preferences.</p>

         <br/>
         -->
    
    <p>The menu bar at the top of the app displays the current tool name and links that open the Tool and Action menus.  Just below that is a bar that allows you to change the current tool (by clicking left or right) and a button that displays and changes the active category.</p>
    
    <p class="help">The <em>Settings</em> menu (in the upper left-hand corner) opens a page with settings specific to the current tool.</p>
    <p class="help">The <em>Action</em> menu (in the upper right-hand corner) displays the following choices:</p>
    <ul class="help">
      <li><b>About:</b> Open the About dialog.</li>
      <li><b>Prefs:</b> Open the app <a class="pageLink" href="#preferencesHelp">Preferences</a> to specify global options.</li>
      <li><b>Login/Logout:</b> Login or logout of the WordPress server.</li>

    <strong>Home</strong>
    <p class="help">The <strong>Home</strong> page displays a summary of your data.  It also display information about the server connection if you are logged in to a server. If you use Psygraph without connecting to a server, all data remains on your phone.</p>
    <p class="help">The <strong>Home</strong> settings display your username and the WordPress server URL, which you can edit if you are not logged in.</p>

  <div class="helpPageDiv" id="stopwatchHelp">

    <strong>Stopwatch</strong>
    <p class="help">The <strong>Stopwatch</strong> tool times your meditation sessions or other activities. The reset button (on the left) and start/stop button (on the right) and allow you to reset, start and stop the stopwatch.</p>
    <p class="help">The <strong>Stopwatch</strong> settings let you add a GPS location and phone accelerometer data to the event.  The GPS location is determined when the stopwatch stops, and the acceleration data is collected at the rate specified in the "Update interval" widget.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="timerHelp">

  <strong>Timer</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Timer</strong> tool is a countdown alarm: the top widget displays the amount of time left and the bottom widget displays the total amount of time. The start/stop and reset buttons allow you to control the timer status. When the timer has elapsed (i.e. when the top field reaches zero), an alarm goes off that displays a text message and/or sound. The timer can be configured to loop (repeat) at periodic or random intervals.</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Timer</strong> settings configure the timer in different ways. The timer alarm governs what happens when the timer elapses: a text message, a sound, neither, or both.  The alarm sound and text message are specific to each category, and are changed on the category section at the bottom of the settings.  If the loop checkbox is selected, the timer restarts when it has finished (as long as the application is running). The reset interval and random interval fields specify the length of time the timer runs, which is the reset interval plus a random amount of time which does not exceed the random interval.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="counterHelp">

  <strong>Counter</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Counter</strong> tool allows you to count your breath (or anything else you want to count). The black button increments the count, and the white button resets that count.  The count can also be incremented by shaking the device or by clicking anywhere on the screen (see the tool settings and application preferences).  You can practice mindfulness of breath by counting every breath by pressing the black button, which draws an enso (circle) on the screen.  When the enso is complete, pressing the reset button results in a beep to indicate that your count matched the desired count (which is 10 by default).  Your ability to keep track of the number of breaths without looking at the screen is then a measure of mindfulness (or the amount your mind wanders).</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Counter</strong> settings enable you to set a motion alarm (which increments the count), and to set a count target.  The motion alarm has a threshold and a behavior that happens when that threshold is exceeded.  The 'Count target', 'Count target behavior' and 'Show count' widgets are used for breath counting.  Count target indicates the number of breaths you wish to count up to, the count target indicates the feedback that happen when you press the reset button, and the show count widget shows or hides the enso and current count value.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="noteHelp">

  <strong>Note</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Note</strong> tool allows you create text notes and voice memos.  Two text fields are displayed, one for the note title and one for the text of the note.  The right button is used for recording audio data: the button turns red while recording, and the intensity of the color indicates the power of the recorded signal. Recording is stopped by pressing the button a second time. Notes are saved by pressing the left button: the audio data is stored as MP4 files which can be uploaded to the WordPress server as media files.</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Note</strong> settings allow you to attach location data to the note.  They also allow you to turn off the confirmation dialog that indicates note submission.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="listHelp">

  <strong>List</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>List</strong> tool shows a list of events in the current category. You can select all events for a given tool with the Select Events... button or by clicking on individual events. Several operations can be performed on the selected events, such as deleting them, removing them from the local event cache, or changing their category.</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>List</strong> settings allow you to choose which tool's data should be displayed.  It also allows you to specify which columns of data should be displayed.  By default, only notes (events from the note tool) are displayed.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="graphHelp">

  <strong>Graph</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Graph</strong> tool displays several signals as a function of time.  By default, the graph tool shows the ratio of correct to incorrect responses from the <strong>count</strong> tool, aggregated into daily bars.  Therefore, it displays a measure of your mindfulness.</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Graph</strong> settings allow you to specify the display of other signals, as well as to specify the aggregation interval.  Other signals which can be plotted include data from the phone's accelerometer, time spent as measured by the stopwatch and timer, or simply a plot of the counter data.</p>

<div class="helpPageDiv" id="mapHelp">

  <strong>Map</strong>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Map</strong> tool is in BETA status, and is only available if debugging is turned on.  Pressing the round button allows you to start or stop gathering continuous location (GPS) data. Pressing the pin icon centers the map at the current location. Map markers can be created by clicking on the current location icon (a Sierpinsky triangle), or double-clicking anywhere on the map.</p>
  <p class="help">The <strong>Map</strong> settings allow you select the data provider used for the map imagery (either Open Street Map or ArcGIS, and MapBox if you have debugging turned on). You can also select to display all markers or all paths for the current category, as opposed to just the selected markers and paths. Selected events are always displayed, and are selected using the List tool. You can also select power saving mode, which governs location updates in the background, and set the desired accuracy.</p>
