                    <p>Psygraph keeps track of your meditation, breathing, and mindfulness through the use of tools such
                        as a timer, counter, periodic gong, and note-taker. The collection of that data allows you to
                        visualize your behavioral history and optionally email that data to yourself for further analysis.</p>

                    <p>The Psygraph app collects data for your analysis when you use its tools (e.g. the stopwatch or counter).
                        That data includes things such as location (GPS), accelerometer, and heart rate information collected from attached bluetooth devices.
                        In more detail:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>No data is stored except on the device itself, and you are the only one with access to that data (unless you chose to email that data to yourself).</li>
                    <li>We do not sell ads or have any access to your data (i.e. you are not the product).</li>
                    <li>Psygraph is open-source; the source code is available on GitHub: http://github.com/psygraph.</li>
                    <li>Our legal policy is "use this software at your own risk", although we believe that there is little risk.</li>
                    <li>We are happy to provide this software freely, and hope that it improves both your meditation and the quality of your life (which thereby improves the world).</li>
